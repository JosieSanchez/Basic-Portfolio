		<img src="images/josie.jpg" alt="Josie" id="bio-image">

		<p> I was born in the "Windy City" and left when I was 31 years old.  My family and I had to move to a warmer climate so that our young child at the time did not have to depend on medicine for the rest of her young life.  After one week here my daughter's seasonal bronchitis has not returned and she is now 17.  It was sad to leave all of our family behind but the baby came first.  I have come to enjoy the heat and humidity that the "Sunshine" state offers and cannot see myself returning to the cold winter days.</p>

		<p>I have dabbled in many different business/career adventures and always come back to my passion with computers.  I am looking to change my current career in hospitality of 20 plus years and finally take my spot in the creative/technology industry.</p> 

		<p>If you are looking for a dependable,  hardworking, loyal and diverse person to work with, don't look any further.  All I need is for you to trust that I will do my best for you and the end result will prove that all someone needs is an opportunity to showcase themselves.</p>
